This file serves as a placeholder for LLaMA-compatible text models.

You can place your model files in this directory to make them available to the LLaMA text processing tools.  
Alternatively, models may be copied directly into the application's output directory.

To enable automatic discovery and loading, keep all LLaMA text models under the `models/llama/text/` directory.  
Models can also be selected and loaded manually via the **aiagent** application user interface.
