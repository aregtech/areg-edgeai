# Models Directory

This directory contains pre-trained models contributed by third-party organizations and individual developers.  

The models are sourced from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models).  

To use a model with the `llama.cpp` application:  
1. Select the model compatible with `llama.cpp`.  
2. Download the model files.  
3. Copy them into the `models/llama/text` directory.  

Once placed in the correct folder, the models are ready for testing and experimentation.
